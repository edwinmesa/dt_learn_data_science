# Notation

### O(1) means in constant time - independent of the number of items. 
### O(N) means in proportion to the number of items.
### O(log N) means a time proportional to log(N)
### Basically any 'O' notation means an operation will take time up to a maximum of k*f(N)
### where:
### k is a constant multiplier
### f() is a function that depends on N
